Like the gerund, the gerundive is often used to express purpose.\nNote: such clauses function grammatically as either subject or object of the governing verb:\nIn the first example, that the line of battle was stationed here is the SUBJECT of accidit. (What happened? [That the line of battle was stationed here] happened.)\nIn the second example, that they did not undertake a war... is the OBJECT of effecit. (What did he bring about?
